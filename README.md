##CMSC320 Final Project
##Introduction
Human Trafficking has always been a major problem in the world and it has devastating effects on its victims.  With new databases we can examine risk factors in order to help mitigate this problem and counter the abusers.  In this project I will be examing the age of the victims, knowledge of the abuser, type of abuse used for trafficking, and whether the victim was abducted or not.  The data that I will use comes from the CTDC and contains information from all over the world.  In order to keep a reasonable scope for this project the data has been pre-processed to include online United States cases.  These cases range from years 2015 to 2018.
