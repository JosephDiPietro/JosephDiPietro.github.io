## CMSC320 Final Project
## Introduction
Human Trafficking has always been a major problem in the world and it has devastating effects on its victims.  With new databases we can examine risk factors in order to help mitigate this problem and counter the abusers.  In this project I will be examing the age of the victims, knowledge of the abuser, type of abuse used for trafficking, and whether the victim was abducted or not.  The data that I will use comes from the CTDC and contains information from all over the world.  In order to keep a reasonable scope for this project the data has been pre-processed to include online United States cases.  These cases range from years 2015 to 2018.  Using data analytics we can predict whether abusers are more violent or have a closer relation to the victim based on factors like age.
## Libraries Used
This project will be completed in Python using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries.
## Pre - Processing
The data contains too much information to process all at once so we will cut it down to just cases in the United States.  In addition, the format of the data needs to be altered for cases of missing data.  The way missing data is handled is to have a -99 as a placeholder, but that will skew our data when we attempt to do any grouby mechanics.  To fix this we have to alter the actual excel file and replace all -99s to 0s.  This will also give us a pseudo binary flag for any column with 0 being false and 1 being true.  The data set can be found here [TraffickingData](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/dataset/resource/511adcb7-b1a2-4cc7-bf2f-0960d43a49cc).
